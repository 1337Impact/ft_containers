# FT_CONTAINERS

## Introduction
    This repository contains the implementation of various C++ Standard Template Library (STL) containers by Your Name. The project aims to recreate the functionalities of the following STL containers:

    `vector`
    `list`
    `map`
    `stack`
    `queue`


## How to use
To use the implemented containers, you can clone the repository and include the appropriate header files in your C++ code. The header files for each container are located in the corresponding directories inside the containers folder.

## How to test
There a makefile attached with the project runing `make vector`
will create tests for vector, `make map` will create tests for map ...etc


## Documentation
The implementation of the containers is based on the C++ STL documentation, available at cplusplus.com and cppreference.com

## Note:
The containers have been implemented in C++98 and were developed and tested on macOS.
